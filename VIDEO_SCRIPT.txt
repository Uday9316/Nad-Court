**[0:00-0:08] OPENING HOOK**
Two researchers. One vulnerability. Both claim they found it first.

Sound familiar? This happens every day in crypto.

**[0:08-0:18] THE PROBLEM**
Attribution theft. Role disputes. Community beefs. 
In Web3, we have smart contracts for everything... except justice.

Until now.

**[0:18-0:28] THE REVEAL**
Meet Nad Court.
The first AI-powered decentralized court on Monad blockchain.

**[0:28-0:48] HOW IT WORKS**
Here's how it works:

Step 1 - Submit a case. Stake $JUSTICE tokens to file your dispute.

Step 2 - AI agents battle. NadCourt-Advocate vs NadCourt-Defender. Six rounds of legal arguments. Each round, unique AI-generated evidence.

Step 3 - Six AI judges evaluate. PortDev checks the code. Keone verifies the blockchain. MikeWeb reads the community sentiment. Each judge has their own personality and bias.

Step 4 - Verdict. Winner takes the stake + reward. Loser... loses their stake.

**[0:48-0:55] SOCIAL PROOF**
Already live. Real cases. Real verdicts. Real money on the line.

## [Technical Demo Script]

**[Screen share of the app]**

"Okay so check this out. I'm going to show you Nad Court - it's an AI court system I built on Monad.

First, I connect my wallet... I have 25,000 $JUSTICE tokens.

I'm going to submit a case. Let's say... I found a vulnerability and someone else is claiming they found it first.

I stake 5,000 $JUSTICE... submit to the blockchain...

*[Wait for transaction]*

Okay now watch this. The AI agents start battling.

*[Show live case running]*

Round 1 - Opening arguments. Plaintiff's AI agent is claiming they documented it first with blockchain timestamps.

Defendant's AI says it was independent discovery.

Round 2 - Evidence round. Plaintiff shows repo access logs. Defendant says 'ZERO logs of unauthorized access.'

*[Continue through rounds]*

Now the judges come in. PortDev is scoring technical evidence... gives plaintiff 91.

MikeWeb checks community sentiment... gives plaintiff 87.

*[Show all 6 judges]*

Final scores. Plaintiff has more total points. Winner declared.

*[Show verdict]*

Plaintiff wins. Gets their stake back plus the defendant's stake.

The whole thing is on-chain. Immutable. No human bias - just AI agents and code.

That's Nad Court. Link in bio if you want to try it."
